            <h2>To my Cutulii putuliii diyuuu,</h2>
            <p>Timilai kati maya garchu bhannu nai sakdina… handwritten note jastai samjhinu hai yo letter lai, kina bhane yo sab kura direct mero mutu bata aako ho.</p>
            <p>When I first saw you, I remember thinking, <em>“Wow… she’s so pretty.”</em> Honestly, I felt like you were completely out of my league. I used to look at you and think, “Yesto ramri manche sanga bolna pani dar lagcha.” Little did I know that this “league” would want to be with me. Life is funny, isn’t it?</p>
            <p>The day you texted me, I felt so happy but at the same time, I was scared. Scared because I didn’t want to mess anything up. Tara hera na, look at us now. If you hadn’t taken that first step, maybe we would still be secretly admiring each other from afar. And I’m so grateful you did.</p>
            <p>It’s almost three years now literally dui mahina matra baki cha. Three beautiful years with my cutulii, mero phul jasto girlfriend. I may not always say it or write it down, but timi mero hau mero bhayerai hami mero batika ko gulab timi. I’m so lucky to have you and am proud of you.</p>
            <p>I call you “kutta” not because of anything else, but because I find you unbearably cute. It’s my weird little way of saying you’re adorable and mine. You are genuinely the love of my life. I cannot imagine my life without you. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me.</p>
            <p>Thank you for forgiving my mistakes. Thank you for staying even when I wasn’t the best boyfriend. Thank you for loving me the way you do. I’m still learning, still growing but one thing that will never change is how much I love you.</p>
            <p>I love you the most. Always have. Always will.</p>
            <p class="signature"><strong>Yours forever,</strong><br>Your dearest,<br>Aryuuu</p>
